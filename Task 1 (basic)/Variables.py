# Task 1: Create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it.
pi = 22/7
print("Type of pi:", float(pi))

# Task 2: Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4.
# Attempting to assign a value to a variable named "for" results in a syntax error
# because "for" is a reserved keyword in Python.
# You cannot use reserved keywords as variable names.
# Uncommenting the following line will raise an error:

# for = 4


# Task 3: Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in different variables
# and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3 years.
# Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100

principal_amount = 1000
rate_of_interest = 5
time = 3

simple_interest = (principal_amount * rate_of_interest * time) / 100
print("Simple Interest for 3 years:", simple_interest)
